      <item value="&lt;p&gt;There are two different classes of data change events, item changes and structural * changes. Item changes are when a single item has its data updated but no positional * changes have occurred. Structural changes are when items are inserted, removed or moved * within the data set.&lt;/p&gt; * * &lt;p&gt;This event does not specify what about the data set has changed, forcing * any observers to assume that all existing items and structure may no longer be valid. * LayoutManagers will be forced to fully rebind and relayout all visible views.&lt;/p&gt; * * &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RecyclerView&lt;/code&gt; will attempt to synthesize visible structural change events * for adapters that report that they have {@link #hasStableIds() stable IDs} when * this method is used. This can help for the purposes of animation and visual * object persistence but individual item views will still need to be rebound * and relaid out.&lt;/p&gt; * * &lt;p&gt;If you are writing an adapter it will always be more efficient to use the more * specific change events if you can. Rely on &lt;code&gt;notifyDataSetChanged()&lt;/code&gt; * as a last resort.&lt;/p&gt; *" />
